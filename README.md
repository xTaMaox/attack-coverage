# Mitre Attack Framework

ATT&CK is a model and framework for describing the actions an adversary takes while operating within an enterprise network. The model can be used to better characterize post compromise adversary behavior with the goal of distilling common behaviors across known intrusion activity into individual or combinations of actions that an adversary may take to achieve their goals. The TTPs described in ATT&CK were selected based on observed APT intrusions from public reporting, and are included in the model at a level of abstraction necessary for effectively prioritizing defensive investments and comparing endpoint intrusion detection capabilities.

# Heat Map Goals:

>Provide transparency to senior leadership on threat hunting strengths and weaknesses
>Perform a gap analysis to demonstrate where resources are needed in your environment
>Emphasize the effectiveness of collaboration among other teams (In order to reach a very good or excellent score, you might need to work with other teams to fill the gap)
>Prioritize techniques based on the most crucial gaps identified
